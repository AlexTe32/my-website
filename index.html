      <h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
      <p>I've been passionate about computers and video games since
        I was a child. That early interest made me curious about how
        games and programs work, and it pushed me to start learning on my own.<br><br>
        During my teenage years, I taught myself Python, focusing on
        basic programming concepts, game development, and small automation
        projects. Coding quickly became one of my favorite ways to be creative and solve problems.<br><br>
        My passion for technology guided my education. I chose to study at the
        Regional Center for Vocational Education and Training “Moša Pijade” in Tetovo,
        North Macedonia, where I completed my secondary education as an Electrical Technician for Computer
        Technology and Automation.<br><br>
        Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the Faculty of Computer Science and
        Engineering in Skopje. In my free time, I enjoy joining game jams and working on side projects that
        help me improve my skills and explore new ideas.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/AlexTe32/Cat-Mouse" target="_blank">Game Jam Finder</a>
        <br>
        <p>Developed a Discord bot in Python that scrapes and shares information about
          upcoming Game Jams. Users can request Game Jam listings on command or set the bot
          to automatically post updates weekly in a specified channel.</p>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/AlexTe32/Cat-Mouse" target="_blank">Cat&Mouse</a>
        <br>
        <p>Developed a simple Python simulation as a university project to estimate how long
          it would take 3 cats to catch 100 mice, given they catch 3 mice in 3 minutes</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://alexte32.github.io/Mravka/" target="_blank">Langton's Ant</a>
      <br>
        <p>Built a Langton's Ant simulation in JavaScript, showcasing emergent
          behavior from simple rules using HTML5 Canvas.</p>
